# playground

Welcome to Jeongho's Playground! I'm excited to show you some of my Java projects.
I've been programming in Java for several years, and I enjoy creating new applications 
that solve problems and make life easier. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out 
to me if you have any questions or feedback!"
